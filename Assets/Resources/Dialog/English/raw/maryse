/Well hello, little girl. Welcome to my house.
/My name is Maryse.
/Oh oh oh ^-^
/Come on, make yourself at home. It’s not that spacious around here, but quite cheerful.
/Still, since I’ve rearranged my cave, we have more space.
/Do you want a cookie ?
/Oh oh oh ^-^
/No, Not at all !
/Not at all.
/Even if I’m old, I’m still in my right mind.
/A little dog lives with me, in the cave.
/He’s very cute. Well, sometimes he might disobey !
/Now that he has a room just for him, he can play all he wants.
/Oh oh oh ^-^
/No, Not at all !
/Not at all.
/Mia has lived with me for a few months now. I welcomed her here, in my house.
/She’s so nice ! She helps me in everything I do.
/Every week she brings me a new DVD from the video club.
/I wonder why she goes there so much, by the way ^-^
/She’s really as cool as a cream, this little crispbread.
/Oh oh oh ^-^
/No, Not at all !
/Not at all.
/You know, I experienced war myself. The enemy was here, in Vie-Lhaj.
/We all gathered in the city hall, that we had previously fortified.
/A real bastion.
/Well, even duke Gunter Von Geberg had joined us !
/With the old sage, we found arms ; he had three AK47, I had a whip.
/Yes, a whip. I know to use that tool.
/If you’re interested, I might show you, one day.
/Anyway, there was no hope anymore, but we decided to get out.
/« WAAAAAAR » I cried. I had quite a voice, in the old days.
/Vlam, bam, vlam, what a defeat they had ! 
/I swear to God, a wipeout for them.
/The good ol’ days...
