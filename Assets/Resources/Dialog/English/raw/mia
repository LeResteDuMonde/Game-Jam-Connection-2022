/Hello you !
/My name is Mia ! And you ?
/Nice to meet you !
/Can I help you ?
/Oh ! That...
/Don’t worry about it, it’s not cancer.
/It happened a week ago, during a boozy night.
/I was with someone...
/I fell for this crunchy boy !
/If only I could meet him again <3
/Yes, I live in this house with Maryse !
/It’s my best friend !
/Well, the only one I have actually...
/It’s a really nice lady. She got rid of every person who would be mean to me.
/Ever since she took me under her wing, I’m a free crispbread, I can take walks wherever I want in Vie-Lhaj.
/I don’t give a shit anymore
/For example, I like to go to the video club !! I really like the idea.
/Serge told me about it and he was so right ...
/I moved here five years ago now. I am quite new here.
/But now that you arrived, I’m not the newbie ^^
/I really like this village. It’s quiet and convivial.
/Even if, sometimes, there is some animosity....
/Serge told me someone didn’t like him...
/Oh, hum... I don’t really know what to say ?
/It’s just a friend, yeah !
/Yes, yes, just a friend...
/What ? Old sage told you about us ?
/You can't teach an old dog new tricks...
/Well, I like him, I really like him, I’m crazy about him !!
/As soon as I think about him, I’m shaking, and when I see him, I’m browning...
/Do you think one day I could have a toast with him ?
/I’m scared, but he is the subject of all my dreams <3
