/Hey !
/Hey !
/Hey !
/You good ?
/I’m great !
/Amazing !!
/How d’you do ?
/Yes ! I’m loving it when it’s sunny.
/It reminds me that day when I wanted to eat outside, with intense heat.
/It was so hot that Teddy had lost all his fur !
/If you saw Poppy !! He was melting.
/I can’t stay still !
/Well, I’m plugged in all day long, so…
/Let’s hope I don’t lose it !
/I see you’re laughing, but it already happened to me, once !
/During that time when I lived in the skate-park.
/I didn’t have what to warm me up, nor did I have food ; painful memories.
/I pretty much experienced everything, you know.
/Well, one day that I was in the skate-park, someone I never saw brang me something to warm me up.
/It was a universal battery, 200V : what a thing !
/I think you know what happened : I was cold, I was down, then I see this huge plug…
/Immediately I plugged me in !! Wooof !
/Short circuit.
/Luckily I had a circuit breaker, otherwise I wouldn’t be here talking to you.
/I live with Zephyr and Elisabeth ! We’re flatmates.
/I saw pretty big things there…
/I shouldn’t talk ‘bout it… But I’m sure you won’t repeat, right ? 
/One day, we organized a party at home, we invited all the village : oh my god ’t’was a such a mess.
/That night I saw Mia for the first time.
/She wasn’t quite the popular girl, at the time.
/But what was my surprise when I saw that Dominique was flirting with her !!
/To see a Von Gegerb, in the middle of the seduction act, in front of everyone ! What a shame for the daddy !
/During the party they went into Zephyr’s bedroom (I can tell, I saw them like I see you now).
/All night long there were cracs.
/Crunch !
/Crunch !
/The morning, when I saw her, she wasn’t the same !!
/You won’t tell her, right ?
/Mia ? Mia ? Mia ?
/I suppose somebody couldn’t keep a secret, right ?
/Well yes, it’s true, everything.
/I love her, she loves me, we love each other.
/But that’s a secret, please don’t tell anybody !
/It reminds me the day when…
/What ?
/You don’t want to hear my tales anymore ?
/Next time, I suppose ?
