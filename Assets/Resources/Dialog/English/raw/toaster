/Hey !
/Hey !
/Hey !
/You good ?
/Iâ€™m great !
/Amazing !!
/How dâ€™you do ?
/Yes ! Iâ€™m loving it when itâ€™s sunny.
/It reminds me that day when I wanted to eat outside, with intense heat.
/It was so hot that Teddy had lost all his fur !
/If you saw Poppy !! He was melting.
/I canâ€™t stay still !
/Well, Iâ€™m plugged in all day long, soâ€¦
/Letâ€™s hope I donâ€™t lose it !
/I see youâ€™re laughing, but it already happened to me, once !
/During that time when I lived in the skate-park.
/I didnâ€™t have what to warm me up, nor did I have food ; painful memories.
/I pretty much experienced everything, you know.
/Well, one day that I was in the skate-park, someone I never saw brang me something to warm me up.
/It was a universal battery, 200V : what a thing !
/I think you know what happened : I was cold, I was down, then I see this huge plugâ€¦
/Immediately I plugged me in !! Wooof !
/Short circuit.
/Luckily I had a circuit breaker, otherwise I wouldnâ€™t be here talking to you.
/I live with Zephyr and Elisabeth ! Weâ€™re flatmates.
/I saw pretty big things thereâ€¦
/I shouldnâ€™t talk â€˜bout itâ€¦ But Iâ€™m sure you wonâ€™t repeat, right ? 
/One day, we organized a party at home, we invited all the village : oh my god â€™tâ€™was a such a mess.
/That night I saw Mia for the first time.
/She wasnâ€™t quite the popular girl, at the time.
/But what was my surprise when I saw that Dominique was flirting with her !!
/To see a Von Gegerb, in the middle of the seduction act, in front of everyone ! What a shame for the daddy !
/During the party they went into Zephyrâ€™s bedroom (I can tell, I saw them like I see you now).
/All night long there were cracs.
/Crunch !
/Crunch !
/The morning, when I saw her, she wasnâ€™t the same !!
/You wonâ€™t tell her, right ?
/Mia ? Mia ? Mia ?
/I suppose somebody couldnâ€™t keep a secret, right ?
/Well yes, itâ€™s true, everything.
/I love her, she loves me, we love each other.
/But thatâ€™s a secret, please donâ€™t tell anybody !
/It reminds me the day whenâ€¦
/What ?
/You donâ€™t want to hear my tales anymore ?
/Next time, I suppose ?
