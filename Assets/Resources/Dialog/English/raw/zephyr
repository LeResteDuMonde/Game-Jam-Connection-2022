/Hello…
/My name, even if you don’t care, as all the villagers of this dark place, is Zephyr.
/Lost as the wind, I wander around here, this place where I’ll lay one day or another.
/...
/You are right, why talk to me ?
/To me, Zephyr the misunderstood ?
/Pain that doesn’t talk shows itself even more,
/But I hide mine, hurtful mistake.
/The only ones that understand me
/Are dogs
/The faithful spirits
/Of the most kind species mother Nature has ever conceived. 
/I lost every one, because I never had one.
/Feel well ?
/I forgot the meaning of this many years ago…
/Since that day when, as a child, I experienced the most traumatizing thing a man can live in three lives.
/The sun was rising, the birds were singing, I was waking up.
/I stood up.
/And… I hurt my toe, crashing it onto this furniture, this wardrobe my grandmother gave me when she retired.
/My toe hurt, a huge suffering, the one that announce despair and death.
/You know my story.
/What is this key ? To which door will I apply it ?
/...
/A dog, in Maryse’s hosse ? Well, I heard of it, without knowing it was truth.
/I do thank you, and I’ll check on that, if Fate allows it.
/Do not be mistaken about my intentions.
/Death wouldn’t sedate my pain nor I.
/I’m here, looking at the horizon and the see, because I saw something I couldn’t think of with five lives.
/This calm rumbling, the sweet foam, that’s what calms me down.
/I thought I would see a dog down there...
