/Good morning madam, did you just move in ? Allow me to wish you willkomen. I’m Dominique Von Gerberg, french teacher in Vie-Lhaj.
/Any grammar question ?
(whispers) … I shouldn’t have told my name… 
/Kind of, but anyway, it doesn’t matter, do not associate me with this person, (whispers) this swine.
/Listen, in terms of education, we struggle to make ends meet. But if you saw the students… (whispers) nothing really worth it. Anyway, if you have any grammar question, don’t hesitate, I love syntaxis and juxtapositions, it’s my passion.
Oh… well…this is nothing… Anyway…
