/Heyheyhey
/My name’s Poppy, you already heard me, I suppose ?
/You know, Shitty Place.
/Well, the actor, the handsome one… it’s me !
/Classy ! Of course.
/You want to tell me something ?
/My friend !! If you must watch one Sitcom in your life, this IS the one.
/I pitch you :
/I, Poppy, live in a shitty city.
/Nobody likes each other.
/Weeee hate each otheeeeer soooo muuuuuch...
/(Public laughs)
/Hopefully it’s different in Vie-Lhaj.
/Yes I do.
/You know, in Shitty Place, I do skate.
/Sometimes Maryse comes here, and she skates too.
/Don’t worry, I’m the one for you. I know this village perfectly.
/I’m something of a star myself, given that I played in Shitty Place, so everyone told me the good places.
/You can go to the beach. So beautiful down there.
/It’s not always been like that.
/When I arrived here, it was just a mess.
/I, Poppy, stand for that ?
/(Public laughs)
/It was even uglier than Shitty Beach in Shitty Place !
/(Public laughs)
/I had them clean all that up, and now, everyone wants to go there.
/Thank you Poppy !
/(Public : thaaank youuu Poooppyyyy)
/Then, after the beach, you can go to the main square, where the old sage lives.
/I love that place ! We always meet new people.
/I confess I dropped off a little surprise there...
/Ahh, this good old Mister Mayor !
/Talkative, isn’t he ?
/(Public laughs)
/You know, he’s in the middle of an electoral fight, right now.
/So obviously, he’s trying to find help where he can.
/But who is better than Poppy ?
/(Public : POOOOPPYYYYY)
/In order to embarrass his new electoral rival for the sit of mayor, he asked me a little favor.
/So much like House of Shit, I swear.
/(Public laughs).
/You remember, right, I play in Shitty Place.
/So he asked me, well, to do what I knew best...
/On Teddy’s lawn...
/You know, this sauvage place near the city hall..
/I dropped off a little surprise there...
/(Public : arghhhh)
