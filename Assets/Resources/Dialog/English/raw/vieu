/Greeting, young fella !
/I’m the old sage of this village, but everybody knows me as…
/The old sage.
/Hmm hm !
/You seem to be so witty !
/I sense you’ll have a great future in Vie-Lhaj !
/What would you want to know, my ladybug ?
/Hmmm, that’s… correct !
/Yes indeed, I’m the oldest man in Vie-Lhaj.
/I saw everything, I heard everything, ever since I was born, a hundred years ago.
/You believe it ? Your incredulity is stupendous, young butterfly, you do not believe what you don’t smell.
/I’m gonna tell you something, my girl.
/A secret, that only I know. 
/Do you know Mia ? And Serge ?
/Well, these two young souls love each other, like little rabbits.
/I always see them looking at each other’s ass. She in the video club, he in the bar.
/I swear it is truth.
/You really don’t know ? Isn’t it obvious ?
/I’m not young, nor a fool, therefore I’m the old sage.
/Hmmm…
/All these younglings… They’re getting on my nerves. No one is worthy of my attention in this village.
/It’s not that I don’t like them ; I just don’t care.
/I hope you’ll be different !
/Hm hm.
/HMMM HM HM
/That is not a dog that did that. Do watch more carefully.
/This divine shape, gracious in its order, that follows in harmony the proportions I declared the best.
/That is the art of a fair man !
/I hate him, I hate him.
