/Dear fellow citizen, I salute you ! I’m Teddy, and I represent the workers of this village. I’ve heard from my associates that you would move in Vie-Lhaj. I’m so glad to meet you.
/Would you like a cup of coffee ?
/Of course I’m running. Do you really thing this useless mayor would help our beautiful village, m’lady ? You see, I am the Republic, madam, and I know what is it that citizens want. I hear them, and I promise I will change everything, I will make these lands great again, I will create a great nation !
/Well, of course I pull the string. Maybe you already met him, but if you go to the main square, you can talk to the oldest soul around here. Mister Mayor is jealous of me, because this oldest soul, the old sage, supports me for the next elections : he provides wise advices.
/Madam, you can’t say that ! I won’t permit it ! Do not reduce me to my cuteness, and stop looking at me this way !
/Poppy ? Of course I know him. I love this gay. Thanks to me, my flowers have regained their youth. It’s incredible how his feces are full of nutriments ! Since he came, we often take coffee and cigarette together ; my plants are very grateful.
